# Analysis of Industrial Growth, Unemployment, and Migration Patterns in India
## Introduction
Briefly introduce the objectives of the project:
- Analyze the growth of industrial sectors across various states in India.
- Study unemployment rates and labor participation across regions.
- Investigate migration patterns influenced by economic factors.

## Data Sources
List the datasets used:
- Factories Data: Dataset containing information on the number of factories in different states over years.
- Unemployment Data: Dataset detailing unemployment rates and labor participation across regions.
- Migration Data: Dataset providing insights into migration patterns across states.

## Data Preprocessing
### Factories Data
- Loading and cleaning the data.
- Handling missing values using SimpleImputer.
- Calculating Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for each state.
- Visualizing trends for selected states and overall state growth.
### Unemployment Data
- Loading and exploring the unemployment dataset.
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Dropping irrelevant columns.
  - Encoding categorical data (Region, Date).
### Migration Data
- Cleaning and preparing migration data:
- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Handling missing values.
- Visualizing migration trends by state and age group.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Factories Data
- Visualizing factory growth trends over time for specific states (e.g., Assam, Delhi, Bihar).
- Analyzing overall state growth using line plots and bar charts.
### Unemployment Data
- Exploring unemployment rates and labor participation using seaborn bar plots.
- Analyzing the relationship between employed population and unemployment rates.
### Migration Data
- Visualizing migration patterns:
- Bar charts depicting migration numbers by state and gender.
- Analyzing specific age group migrations.

## Machine Learning Models
### Predicting State Development
- Using Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  - Classifying states based on their CAGR into developed and less developed.
  - Training and evaluating SVM model performance.
### Predicting Unemployment Rates
- Applying Multiple Linear Regression:
  - Training separate models for predicting unemployment rates.
  - Evaluating model accuracy using R-squared scores.

## Results and Discussion
### Industrial Growth and Development
- Analysis of CAGR results and SVM predictions.
- States identified as developed and less developed based on industrial growth.
### Unemployment Analysis
- Evaluation of unemployment rate predictions.
- Discussion on factors influencing unemployment across regions.
### Migration Patterns
- Insights into migration trends from Bihar and implications on state economics.
- Visualizations highlighting male and female migration patterns.

## Conclusion
Summarize key findings:
- Identification of states with significant industrial growth and challenges.
- Insights into unemployment rates and labor market dynamics.
- Implications of migration patterns on regional economies.
